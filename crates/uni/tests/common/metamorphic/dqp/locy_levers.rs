//! W4: Locy programs through the DQP levers.
//!
//! The Cypher levers compare one query down two execution paths. These do the
//! same for Locy: each program runs on both sides of a lever — primary and a
//! pristine fork, live and a pinned snapshot, before and after a flush — and
//! every derived relation must be the same bag on both. The programs cover each
//! rule family: a plain rule, FOLD, recursion with stratified negation, a
//! variable-length body, per-path ALONG under a FOLD, ALONG with BEST BY over
//! cycles, and a recursive FOLD reading its children's folded values.
//!
//! **Activation.** Each side's `LocyResult::metrics()` carries the evaluation's
//! scan counters, so a lever is held to the same witness its Cypher form uses,
//! for *every* program: the fork side scanned a branch, the pinned side read a
//! snapshot, the unflushed side read L0 and the flushed side storage alone.
//!
//! Not applicable: the plan-cache lever (Locy evaluation has no plan cache, so
//! the witness could never move) and the delete lever (its law, "a deletion
//! only removes rows", fails for a program with `IS NOT`).
//!
//! Run with:
//!   cargo nextest run -p uni-db --test integration -E 'test(/metamorphic::dqp::locy_levers::/)'

// Rust guideline compliant
