//! proving that SET fires says nothing about DETACH DELETE — so those get

/// Three states, and the third one needs justifying. The first draft of this

/// "pending" variant becomes the permanent home of every hard case. That was
/// right about the risk and wrong about the facts: 27 of these operators are
/// plainly *reachable* — a MATCH emits `GraphScanExec`, UNWIND emits
/// `GraphUnwindExec` — they simply have no test asserting it. Filing them under
/// `Unreachable` would have written a falsehood into the data, and would have
/// broken [`super::gate::unreachable_operators_stay_unreachable`] the moment
/// anyone proved one.
///
/// So `Unproven` exists, and the dumping-ground risk is handled by a **ratchet**
/// instead: `MAX_UNPROVEN` may never increase. New operators must arrive
