//! Regression: any **`LargeUtf8`-typed** `YIELD` column came back as `NULL`
//! from `derived`, while `QUERY` returned it correctly.
//!
//! Named for the string *literal* case because that is how it was found — while
//! adding `derived` assertions to the TCK during the schemaless
//! property-inference work — but the trigger is the Arrow type, not literals,
//! and the real blast radius is **every string-returning function**. See
//! `string_literal_yield_string_functions_reach_derived` below.
//!
//! ## Measured behaviour before the fix
//!
//! | YIELD expression      | `derived`  | `QUERY` |
//! |-----------------------|------------|---------|
//! | `'patch' AS a`        | **`NULL`** | `patch` |
//! | `toUpper(n.name) AS a`| **`NULL`** | `A`     |
//! | `0.5 AS a`            | `0.5`      | `0.5`   |
//! | `3 AS a`              | `3`        | `3`     |
//! | `true AS a`           | `true`     | `true`  |
//!
//! Declaring a schema makes no difference — this is not the schemaless defect.
//!
//! ## Root cause (fixed)
//!
//! `arrow_to_value` (`uni-store/src/storage/arrow_convert.rs`) had a
//! `StringArray` (Arrow `Utf8`) arm but **no `LargeStringArray` (`LargeUtf8`)
//! arm** — the identifier appeared nowhere in the file. A `LargeUtf8` column
//! fell through every arm to the trailing `Value::Null` fallback.
//!
//! Locy hits that constantly. `infer_expr_type` types string literals *and*
//! `toString`/`toLower`/`toUpper`/`trim`/`replace`/`substring`/`left`/`right`/
//! `reverse`/`type` — plus its catch-all — as `LargeUtf8`. That type lands in
//! `LocyProject`'s `target_types` and in the derived registry schema, and
//! `plan_locy_project` inserts a lossless cast to it. The cast is not the
//! destroyer; it just moves the value into the type the decoder could not read.
//!
//! The other literal types were unaffected because `Int64Array`/`Float64Array`/
//! `BooleanArray` arms exist. A *declared* `DataType::String` property maps to
//! Arrow `Utf8` and hit the `StringArray` arm; a schemaless one is `LargeBinary`
//! and hit the cv-codec arm. Only `LargeUtf8` had no home — hence "schema
//! presence is irrelevant".
//!
//! `QUERY` was correct throughout because it never touches Arrow: the SLG
//! resolver evaluates the YIELD expression natively into a `Value`.
//!
//! A `FOLD` rule is a separate story, measured rather than assumed: a plain
//! value column alongside `FOLD` is **dropped by `FoldExec` entirely**, not
//! nulled, so it never reached this decoder at all. Pinned below by
//! `string_literal_yield_under_fold_drops_the_column_entirely` to keep
//! "absent column" and "column holding NULL" from being confused for each other.
//!
//! Two hand-rolled copies of the decoder (`locy_fixpoint.rs`'s
//! `extract_common_value` and `extract_feature_value`) already carried a
//! `LargeStringArray` arm: the same gap was patched privately twice instead of
//! in the shared decoder.
//!
//! This is the defect behind the "string literals in non-KEY YIELD columns
//! return None" limitation recorded in the Locy runtime notes. It was never a
//! designed restriction, and the numeric-encoding workaround it recommends is
//! no longer needed.
//!
//! Run with:
//!   cargo nextest run -p uni-db --test integration \
//!     -E 'test(string_literal_yield)'

// Rust guideline compliant
