//! A Locy rule's facts are rows, its `QUERY` filter is three-valued, and a sum
//! of nothing is 0.
//!
//! * A derived fact is a row (reference §6.2): two derivations of the same row
//!   are one fact. The recursive fixpoint deduplicated through its delta
//!   computation; a non-recursive rule, evaluated in one pass, did not, so three
//!   parallel edges derived `(a, b)` three times.
//! * `QUERY ... WHERE` runs in Locy's in-memory evaluator, where `NULL = x` was
//!   false and `NULL <> x` true, and `AND`/`OR` with a NULL side were NULL even
//!   when the other side decides them. So `QUERY r WHERE a.age <> 0` kept rows
//!   whose `age` is NULL, which the same filter in a rule body (and in Cypher)
//!   rejects.
//! * `SUM` / `MSUM` over a group with no non-null value is 0.0, as Cypher's
//!   `sum` is; it was NULL.
//!
//! Found by the `locy_rule`, `locy_reach` and `locy_fold` relations of
//! `metamorphic::dqp::topo` (W4).
